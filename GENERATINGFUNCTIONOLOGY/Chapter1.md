For $a_{n+1} = 2a_{n} + 1  $, Solution is $a_n = 2^n - 1 $     
For $a_{n+1} = 2a_{n} + n $, Solution is $a_n = 2^{n+1} -n - 1$   


## A three term recurrence   
$F_{n+1} = F_n + F_{n-1}$

## A three term boundary value problem    
$$au_{n+1} + bu_n + cu_{n-1} = d_n$$

## Two independent variables
f(n, k) = f(n-1, k) + f(n-1, k-1)   f(n,0)=1
