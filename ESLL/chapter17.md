## Estimation of Parameters when Graph Structure is known

## Estimation of Graph Structure

# Undirected Graphical Model for Discreter Variables

## Estimation of Parameters when Graph Structure is known
### Poisson log-linear modeling
### Gradient descent
### Iterative proportional fitting

## Hidden Nodes

## Estimation of Graph Structure

## Restricted Boltzmann Machines
1 layer of visible units and one layer of hidden units with no connection within each layer.   
* Simpler to compute conditional expectation if connection b/w hidden units are removed.
Simplifies Gibbs Sampling as variables in each layer are independent of one another.
